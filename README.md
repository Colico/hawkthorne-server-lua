# Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne

This 2d platformer is based on Community's [Digital Estate Planning][estate]
episode. It's built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine. Please
[report any issues or bugs][multiplayerissues] you have with the game!

## Downloads ( play the game )
 
If you already have love installed, you can download the
[server][loveserver] and [client][loveclient] files and run the game from there.

Linux users: Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). You'll need at least version
0.8.0.  (Standard Ubuntu packages are too old.) After installing LÖVE, download
the [server file][loveserver] and run it,  then download the [client file][loveclient] and run it.
Everyone gets to play!

## Development ( contribute to the game )

All discussion and development takes place on

contributions you'd like to submit, either open a pull request or create a post
on the subreddit.

### Getting your build up and running

1. Create a free GitHub account - https://github.com/plans
2. Set up Git on your machine - https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
3. Fork https://github.com/NimbusBP1729/hawkthorne-server-lua ( click the 'fork' button at the top of this page )
4. Fork https://github.com/NimbusBP1729/hawkthorne-client-lua
5. Follow the machine specific instructions below

#### OSX

1. Be sure to complete the steps above to get started
2. Install the most recent version of LÖVE - http://love2d.org
2. Open Terminal
3. Make a command line alias to love

		$ alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love'

4. Add the alias to ~/.bash_profile so it works the next time you reboot

		$ echo alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love' >> ~/.bash_profile

5. Download and install the latest version of tmx2lua

		$ curl -OL https://github.com/downloads/kyleconroy/tmx2lua/tmx2lua.osx.tar
		$ tar -xf tmx2lua.osx.tar
		$ sudo cp tmx2lua /usr/bin/tmx2lua

6. Clone your newly forked server repository and change directory
	Note: You have to copy your repository url from github ( ex: https://github.com/username/hawkthorne-server-lua.git )

		$ git clone (your forked repository url)
		$ cd hawkthorne-server-lua

7. Build your maps ( this must be done each time you change a map )

		$ make maps

8. Run the server

		$ love src
		
	A black screen indicates success!

	If you are testing a specific port, you can optionally pass that port using the --port option

		$ love src --port=12345

	You can also test a specific address and port

		$ love src --port=12345 --address="localhost"

6. Clone your newly forked client repository and (in another terminal) change directory
	Note: You have to copy your repository url from github ( ex: https://github.com/username/hawkthorne-server-lua.git )

		$ git clone (your forked repository url)
		$ cd hawkthorne-client-lua

7. Build your maps ( this must be done each time you change a map )

		$ make maps
		

8. Run the server

		$ love src
		
	A blue error message screen indicates the address was found, but we failed to establish a connection.
	Seeing the top of a map currently isn't an indication of the ability to connect.
	
	
	If you are testing a specific port, you can optionally pass that port using the --port option

		$ love src --port=12345

##### OpenAL Issues

Some older versions of OS X have a broken version of OpenAL. If you find the
game crashing after a few minutes of play, you'll need to download a different
version of the Love2D framework which uses OpenAL soft. You can download this
alternate version [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/40773/love-0.8.0-openalsoft.zip)

i)

        $ make && love src
